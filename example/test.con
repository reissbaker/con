lazily infer types for `val`, `def`, `macro`, and `type` bodies during
typechecking, but reserve a slot for them in the scope tree. (well, `macro`
always takes an AST node and returns an AST node, but yeah.)

also lazily evaluate `type`, `val`, and `def` bodies at macro time, similarly
reserving a slot for them in the scope tree pointing to a thunk. referencing
them in a macro forces the thunk to evaluate.
